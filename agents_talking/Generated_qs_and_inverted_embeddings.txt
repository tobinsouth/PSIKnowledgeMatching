***TEST TO SEE THE ACCURACY AFTER INVERTING THE EMBEDDING ON A BUNCH OF QUESTIONS***

Original questions:
['What evidence do we have to suggest that feathered dinosaurs may have exhibited complex mating behaviors similar to modern birds?',
'What biomechanical adaptations did the long necks of sauropod dinosaurs have to support their massive size and reach high vegetation levels?',
'What environmental factors led to the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous period?',
'What evidence of social behavior and group dynamics do we see in the fossil record of dinosaur trackways?',
'What evolutionary mechanisms might have driven the diversification of theropod dinosaurs into various ecological niches during the Mesozoic era?',
'What transitional features in the fossil record provide insights into the evolution of flight in early feathered dinosaurs?',
'What anatomical adaptations in the jaw structures of ceratopsian dinosaurs influenced their feeding behaviors and diet preferences?',
'What multi-disciplinary techniques do paleontologists use to analyze the chemical composition of fossilized bones for insights into ancient environments and dietary habits of extinct species?',
'What evidence from the fossil record supports the hypothesis that dinosaurs may have possessed some form of parental care similar to modern avian species?',
'What insights can the study of dinosaur coprolites provide about the diets and digestive systems of ancient species, and how can this information help us understand their ecological roles?']
